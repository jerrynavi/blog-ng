Ghost, an open source publishing platform built with Node.js, provides a good editing experience and integrations with popular apps and tools out of the box. Its extensive feature set allows users to set up a wide range of content-focused experiences, from developer blogs to newsletters, and exclusive paid-for articles.

Ghost can also be used as a headless content management system (CMS) and is compatible with the major frontend frameworks. There are detailed guides for setting up a custom frontend using any of the popular frameworks or static-site generators.
