Ionic Framework is a UI Toolkit for building cross-platform mobile applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The release of Ionic 5 in early 2020 came with official support for React, enabling React developers to easily build mobile applications using their favorite tools. There isn’t much support for working with forms, however, and many of the existing libraries available for building forms in the React ecosystem do not play nicely with Ionic Framework’s components.

You will learn how to build forms using Ionic React’s UI input components in this tutorial.

Finally, you will learn to make your forms accessible to screen readers by adding helpful text to your inputs’ ARIA attributes.
