Express is a popular backend JavaScript framework for building landing pages and integrated content management systems or integrating APIs with other tools. With over twenty million weekly downloads on npm at the time of writing, the framework's popularity comes from its ease of setup and use, extensibility with first- and third-party middleware functions, and its flexible built-in router.

OpenAPI is a standard for describing HTTP APIs in a document that humans and computers alike can understand or consume. Building APIs according to the OpenAPI specification can ease friction between an API's developer and its consumers, especially in terms of how the API should operate.
